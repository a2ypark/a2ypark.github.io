Hello, my name is Allison Park! I'm a linguist and computational social scientist based in California. My formal background includes sociolinguistics, research in internet linguistic phenomena, and theoretical phonology.

My current primary project involves training and fine-tuning forced alignment models for work with kids' speech. Other interests include language acquisition, sociolinguistics, and multilingualism. I have a soft spot for optimality theory in phonological analysis, and occasionally find myself thinking of other analyses in terms of ranking constraints, just for the love of the paradigm.
